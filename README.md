TODO:
-----

- start working on `flowThrough()` method (most of the code probably goes here?)
- start working on `handleIf()` method. what apron method do we have to call to handle
conditionals?
- figure out how to handle loops with Soots `LoopNestTree` class. How and when to
apply widening?
- figure out how to check the analysis output for an unsafe method
