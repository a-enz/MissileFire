TODO:

-figure out how to interpret constraints added to an 'Abstract1' object and how 
 to get those constraints from the program graph
-start working on handleDef() method (most of the code needs to go here)
-start working on handleIf() method
-figure out why AWrapper class is needed (especially why those exact fields?)
-figure out how to check the analysis output for an unsafe method
-figure out how to handle loops with Soots 'LoopNestTree' class
