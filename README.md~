TODO:
-----

- start working on `flowThrough()` method (most of the code probably goes here?)
- implement missing cases in `handleDef()` method
- start working on `handleIf()` method
- figure out why `AWrapper` class is needed (especially why those exact fields?)
- figure out how to handle loops with Soots `LoopNestTree` class
- figure out how to check the analysis output for an unsafe method
